- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning PHP & AHK.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m organizing and moderating meetings and discussions from Meninas em TI - Ireland group.
- ðŸ™† In my spare time I like to read, cook, walk & being an amateur photographer.

- âš¡ Fun fact: My life turned a bit upside down when I moved to Ireland and started looking for a job in the supply chain sector. I soon realized that the IT industry was very strong here. Aditionally, I've been always interested in various technologies so I decided to try. Since then, I've been loving it!ðŸ¥°
